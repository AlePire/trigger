        <p>
        Nowadays our relationship with anything is interfered by marketing strategies and fashion trends.
        <br>
        Good communication has the ability to shape our desires and our opinions based on what we see and how it is told. 
        <br>
        By making the most of this technique, even an object such as a gun full of negative and violent meanings, can become an object of desire.
        <br> <br>
            <p>
            Trigger is born: a gun label that draws inspiration from streetwear, a fashion subculture known for its bold and daring style.
            <br>
            As for the tone of voice and the attitude towards the audience, “Show off your style” and “You are a natural style leader” are examples of copies that Trigger deliberately uses to leverage each of us’ lust for uniqueness. 
            <br>
            This desire for distinctiveness is satisfied with the opportunity to express your diversity by customizing your gun at will “Show off what reflects your personality, don’t limit yourself”.
            <br>
            A fashionable skin is enough to rewrite the perception that people have of an object.
            Trigger embarks on the process of emptying of meaning to discard the link between weapons and death, turning them into the ultimate must-have accessory.
            <br>
            Trigger investigates our relationship with weapons and death in an irreverent way, 
            making guns cool and stylish objects.
